# Neovim config

## TODO

- come up with a neat way to manage colorschemes
- fugitive "next file" binding
- When doing jumps like `]d` should also do `zz`
- Show signs in statusline indicating workspace level diagnostic issues (clicking on this should toggle Trouble)

Trouble issues
Show signs before file name?
Show severity signs next to file name
