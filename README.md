# Neovim config

This is my Neovim config. There are many like it, but this one is mine ðŸ«¡

### Directories

- `after/ftplugin/[filetype].[extension]` - Filetype specific config
- `plugin/` - Neovim automatically loads in all these files on startup, before the contents of `lua/`
- `lua/` - Loads after the files in `plugin/`
- `vimscript/` - Legacy stuff I haven't yet ported to lua
- `vnip/` - Snippets used by the [hrsh7th/vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip) plugin. Also legacy, and should be ported to lua
